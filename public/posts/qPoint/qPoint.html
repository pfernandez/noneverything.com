<h1>Wave Simulation with CUDA</h2>
<p>
    Two things that I've been wanting to do for a long time are:
    <ol>
        <li>Write my own physics simulation that runs on my laptop's graphics card, and</li>
        <li>Mess around with wave visualizations.</li>
    </ol>
    I had some old code from a year or two ago, when I had tried to write a CUDA based n-body
    simulation, that I never quite got working correctly before I got bored and set it aside. This
    project was a great opportunity to revive it and get the issues sorted out in the context of
    some new physics.

<h2>The Concept</h2>
<p>
    I wanted code that could help me think about spacial dynamics rather than just be another
    complicated thing I have to deal with. I also have a bit to learn before attempting really
    relevant problems anyway, so I decided to at least begin to build something that can function
    as a sort of general-purpose thinking, computing and visualization tool that can grow with
    me as I grow.
</p>
<p>
    The idea behind the code goes something like this: imagine a point in space, just a single
    point without any spacial extent of its own. That point has certain properties that we might
    care about in a given situation: x, y, and z coordinates; mass; amplitude; whatever. The main
    thing is just to clearly define the properties associated with this point that are important
    for the problem and to ignore everything else.
</p>
<p>
    At any given moment, those properties will have certain values, but at the next moment those
    values may have changed. So there's a function that goes along with our point that determines
    how its property values change from one moment to the next. Figuring out what that function is
    is called Physics, and yes, it's the hard part. I like to imagine myself as the point, and then
    think about what forces might be pulling on me, and in what directions. I guess the whole
    "point" of this computer program is to get away from all the extraneous complexity and clear
    a space where it's easy to think about just one thing.
</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>
    I started by defining a "point" data type and giving it the properties it needs. Since I was 
    doing a pretty simple 2D wave simulaton for this project all I needed were x, y, and &Psi;.
</p>
    <pre>
typedef struct {

    float x;
    float y;
    float psi;

} point;</pre>
<p>
    Now I could envision my "point" as a zero-dimensional "container" that carries all of its
    relevant data around with it wherever it goes, make as many copies of the point as I like,
    and scatter them around space by assigning unique values to the properties of
    each and storing them all in a giant array that gets passed to the GPU for number-crunching.
</p>
<p>
    Back in the mindset of a single point, I wrote a GPU function (a.k.a. a "kernel") that takes the
    properties of the point at a single instant in time and replaces them with the values they will
    have at the next instant. A simplified version of it looks like this:
    <pre>
__device__ float t = 0;

__global__ void incrementPoint( point *p ) {

    // CUDA's index for this "point":
    int	i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x
            + threadIdx.x;

    // A disbursive wave packet:
    float r = sqrt( p[i].x*p[i].x
              + p[i].y*p[i].y );
    float alpha = r - c * t;
    p[i].psi = 2 * A * dk * sin( dk * alpha )
          * cos( k * alpha ) / ( dk * alpha );

    // Incrementing the time:
    t += dt;
}</pre>
    where I've defined the constants <code>c, A, k, dk</code> and <code>dt</code> elsewhere. I
    pulled this equation from A. C. Philips' <em>An Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</em>,
    problem 2.2, and some good choices for <code>dk</code> were given in fig. 2.1 of the same text.
</p>
<h2>The Rest</h2>
<p>
    was really just filling in the details, which of course in practice was less than trivial;
    learning to program in CUDA is not for the feint of heart! In fact I probably spent 99% of my
    time on these "details." But it was a worthwhile effort, because now I can plug any equation
    I like into <code>incrementPoint()</code> and get a totally different simulation (with only a
    few other minor tweaks.)
</p>
    The source is all zipped up for your perusal below, written in a verbose coding style and full
    of comments. To run it, you can either compile and run <code>nPoint.cu</code> directly, or
    execute <code>runit.sh</code>, which creates a unique directory where data, images, and a
    video are generated and stored. You'll want to first edit line 33 so that the call to the nvcc
    compiler will work for your machine, and while you're in there take a look at the other options
    I've built in. The actual simulation parameters like the number of points and time step size
    are set at the top of <code>qPoint.cu</code> .
