<h2>Visual Synth</h2>
<p>
For this project, I was interested in exploring the resonances
that emerge via the constructive self-interference of oscilating
time-based patterns. In the same way that an audio synthesizer
can produce an infinite variety of tones by combining simple
waveforms, this application can be used to generate an infinite
variety of patterns using only a single rotating ellipse. In the
future I plan on expanding it with other visualizations, as well
as adding the capacity to generate unique sounds along with the
images, using the same parameters.

Because this is ultimately intended for use as a performance
instrument, I've written it to incude the option to be controlled
with a Midi controller as an alternative to the on-screen controllers.
This is still under development. Although it currently works with
my M-Audio Oxygen49 keyboard, using a different controller would
involve reassigning the Midi CC values in the "controls" file. Also,
the "note" intervals have not yet been mapped to the Midi keys.

For the required data set, I was looking for something that had
the potential to help locate resonant patterns in the elliptical
oscillations. I chose to use the energetic states of the hydrogen
atom (see
<a href="http://astro.unl.edu/naap/hydrogen/levels.html">
http://astro.unl.edu/naap/hydrogen/levels.html
</a>
.) I set the energy of a single electron at "ground" state to 1
(rather than the SI unit of -13.6 eV) in order to focus on the
harmonic properties of the intervals between the states, leaving
only the series 1/1, 1/4, 1/9, ..., 1/n^2. These basic "quanta" of
energy are the basis for all of the macroscopic structure in the
universe, including life, and can be considered truly fundamental;
a musical "scale" certainly worth expressing visually. They are
mapped to buttons ("keys") laid out along the bottom of the screen.
When the speed of rotation is turned all the way up in a given
direction (i.e. with the ROTATE X slider,) the ellipse will
oscillate with a period of 2pi*1/n^2 per frame, with n determined
by the button last clicked.
