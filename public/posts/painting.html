<h2>Painting</h2>
<p>
I want to do a painting, but I don’t really know how, so I get some water-based acrylics and a starter kit of brushes, and I cut a big piece of sheet rock because canvases and oil paints are for real painters. I clamp a two-by-four to my stepladder: a makeshift easel. The sides of the panel are going to want to crumble, so I take some Titanium White and paint around the edges with thick, deliberate strokes-- the way I imagine a real painter would-- then I go around the outside with some blue tape after waiting for it to dry. Figure I’ll trim it out with something better later, if I decide I like it enough to keep it.

I set the thing up on my easel in the garage and give it a long, hard stare. Black and white. That’s all I’m going to use, and shades of gray. Got to remove as many variables as possible. Still life or concept, or improvisation? Or some combination of the three? I turn around and shut the door behind me, and get to bed.

The next night, after the kids are down, I head back out; fiddle with the lights a little. Squeeze out a fat glob of black and a smaller one of white onto an old cookie sheet, swirl a little of each together and find that a little white goes a long way toward making gray. I choose a wide brush and put a big, ugly black rectangle at an angle across the upper left-hand side of my board.

One thing about painters is that their process is a complete mystery; does every stroke look like it’s going to belong to a masterpiece, or does the thing look amateur until the final, brilliant details are fleshed out? Who knows how many mistakes and alternate takes are layered under all those thick contours? That’s a comforting thought, and I set my mind to the idea that, if I take my time and layer on enough paint, eventually it will turn into something I’ll be pleased with.

An hour turns into two, then three. The black shape becomes a tilted building. Smaller black marks become buildings further out; gray marks, their sides. Extra paint left on the brush gets wiped over an empty section: soon I realize it’s a street. I start trying to detail things in, but the shades are wrong, so I go over them again and again, and all at once I hit that place I’m looking for, where everything in my peripheral vision sort of fades out and I start moving quickly, and the awkwardness of the brush and the clumsiness of my hands don’t matter anymore, because I know what I’m doing; I can see it. That’s why I write and do art or anything else that involves creation, for that instant that you’re no longer doing the creating, but are carried along in a process that's beyond what you normally are.

Stepping back after a while, drowsy, I take an objective look at what I’ve produced, and grimace. Guess I’ll take another shot at it tomorrow. Maybe for my next painting I should try that still life.
