<h1>Bash: the FIND command</h1>
<p>
    This is one of those simple commands that I always seem to forget how to use. To search all of
    the subdirectories of <code>myDirectory</code> for a file or directory called 
    <code>myItem</code>, the syntax is
</p>
<pre>find /path/to/myDirectory -name myItem</pre>
<p>If you just want to search from the current directory, you can simply use</p>
<pre>find -name myItem</pre>
<p>Thank you. That is all.</p>
